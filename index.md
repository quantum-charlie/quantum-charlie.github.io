Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I am a first-year theoretical physics PhD student at the University of Exeter. My research is in the field of quantum thermodynamics, specifically looking at quantum spin dynamics equations under the supervision of Dr Simon Horsley and Prof. Janet Anders.


## Projects

* **Developing a Quantum Thermodynamic Theory for Spin Systems** *(Sep. 2021 - Present)*
* **Modelling Heat Transport Through a 'Quantum Wire'** *(Jan. 2020 - Jun. 2021)*

## Teaching

* **Thermal Physics (PHY2023)**: tutor for second-year Natural Sciences students *(21-22)*
* **Mathematics with Physical Applications (PHY2025)**: demonstrator for second-year Physics students *(21-22)*
